## Exam Registration 
Dear Students,

for anybody who wishes to give the exam in the upcoming weeks (before end of April) and needs to have their vote registered in the winter session, please subscribe asap to the "appello" of February 21st.  This is just a formal step to ensure that I will be able to register the exam as part of the Winter session.

If you do not subscribe to the appello of February 21st and you give the exam in the upcoming weeks, I will be forced to register no earlier than in June.

If you read this email late and still want to register for the appello, please email me: I will be able to add you manually even if subscriptions are closed.

All the best,

Michele


## Exam FAQ
Dear Students,

here are some answers to frequently asked questions about the exam.

1) How does the exam work?

The exam is composed of two parts: a project, to be carried out preferentially in groups, and an oral exam with theory questions.

2)  When can we do the exam?
The exam can be done in February or March (at the latest early April). We will arrange dates by email. In both cases, I will officially register the exam as part of the Winter session. Of course, you can do the exam in June or July, but in this case it will be registered in the Summer session.

3) Should we do the exam as a group? 

The project should be presented together as a group. The theory part is an individual exam. In principle, is may be convenient to present the project and give the theory oral in the same date, but if needed we can arrange different dates: therefore, you can give the theory part some time after the group presentation, if you find it more convenient.

4) What will be asked in the theory part?

In the Course Program doc, you find the list of theory topics covered in the course. I highlighted in boldface the the topics that may be asked in the exam. Questions will focus on main concepts, rather than detailed proofs.

5) What should be the project about?

The project should be carried out in preferentially in groups, and it should contain either an information theory part or an inference part (or both). In the "Projects" folder you can find some articles that I proposed as a basis for possible projects, but I am happy to accept proposals on your part. In particular, the project may be an extension of a project you are doing for another exam. If you need further information about the projects, I invite you to contact me via email and we can arrange a quick virtual meeting to discuss.


## Exam 
Dear Students,

this message is mainly addressed to students that have not been regularly attending the lectures, but are planning to give the exam.

1) The exam will involve a project and an oral examination. I will arrange a few options for exam dates, starting in mid-February.

2) Projects will be carried out in groups (preferentially). The project must be a data-analysis project involving either information theory, or inference, or both. In my last lecture, I proposed a few possible projects. The relative references are in the "Projects" folder. I am, however, willing to accept any proposal on your part, including extensions of projects you started for other courses.

3) I will be available to discuss the projects next week, on Monday 10.30-12-30  and Thursday 10.30-12.30 on zoom,

If you cannot attend any of these virtual meetings, please contact me via email to arrange a meeting

4)  In the oral exam, I will  ask you some questions on the course program. Questions will focus on the main concepts, not on proofs. I updated the course program on Moodle, highlighting in boldface the most relevant topics, that will be the object of exam questions. For each topic, I added the relevant references in standard textbooks as well as in my course notes.

Michele Allegra
